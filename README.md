# FMEA-Tool
This web-based FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis) tool is designed to systematically identify, assess, and prioritize risks in processes or products, with a focus on blood transfusion safety as outlined in the study "Risk Evaluation in Blood Transfusion Using Failure Mode and Effects Analysis" (2025).

The tool allows users to enter failure modes, calculate Risk Priority Numbers (RPN), and visualize top risks through interactive charts and reports. It helps enhance patient safety by identifying critical failures and suggesting corrective actions.

Key features include data entry forms, dynamic dashboards with risk visualizations, and exportable reports in PDF and CSV formats.
